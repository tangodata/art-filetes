# Tango Radio Club

The Argentine Tango Society
AM590 Radio Continental (BsAs)
Sundays Midnight

For some time now, The Tango Society has undertaken the immense task of preserving and promoting the Argentine Tango. And what a better way to express that dream than doing it on the air. The wee hours of the morning of Monday, May 2, 2017 were witness to the very first broadcast of Tango Radio Club show, on Radio Continental AM 590 station..

With Jes√∫s Mela as host, a special section by Osmar Spanu, and Silvina Damiani in charge of the script, Tango Radio Club is determined to offer good music and clear and easy-to-understand information about the various aspects and characteristics of this genre through brief interviews of major tango figures as well as archive material provided essentially by the website TodoTango.com.

Our goal is simple; the reason is clear: we aim at creating a space where knowledge, culture and tango productions reached the audience in an entertaining and customized way, but poetically.
